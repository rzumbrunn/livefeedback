# Livefeedback
A minimalistic web-app to track attention during teaching.
## What is it?
It's a website you can host yourself, where your students can anonimously call for slower or faster teaching without feeling called out.
It's based on a flask-socketio server and a redis db for caching.
Currently very WIP
